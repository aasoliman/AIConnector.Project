1)  Overview of the project
 The application provide the people with autism a creative and easy to use way to communicate with others. The application is developed in native mode and uses Android SDK. It is important in this application to have an easy navigation and functions to enable all users specially children.
The application provides different tabs and those tabs the user can access some functions or buttons. When the user access the button, the app will show a large picture of the funciton that he or she wants.

2)Required Android Permissions and why the app needs them
The application requires Read & Write permission to access the SD card.

3)Required Web Services, e.g., GIS, Google, etc., and why the app needs them
The Application does not require web services.

4)Required, built-in, features/devices: GPS, Camera, Gallery, Contacts, SMS, etc. 
The Application does not require such services

5)Testing procedures (emulators, device tests, unit tests, etc.)
The application was set with a requirement for SDK version 17. although it can be compiled to work on older versions.

6)Screenshots
In the folder with this text file there are five images. 
  1)The first image (FirstTab) is for the Food Tab with the different predefined images available for the user. 
  2)The second image (FoodClicked) shows when the user have selected an item from the list. 
  3)The third image (ActivityTab) shows the available activities that the user can select. 
  4)The fourth image (ActivityClicked) shows when the user have selected an item from the list. 
  5)The fifth image (SettingsTab) shows the available option to enter the password to unlock the app or to change the password.

7)Known bugs, limitations, and problems
Currently due to the difficulty to package some images in some folders with the app, I had to use a set of image that can not be changed. Although, I was able to upload some image to the emulator and then load the images from there. Due to this problem, I was not able to use the DB because there are no images loaded in the SD card. However, I have included my DB code with this project.
Another problem is, since I am using Tab Fragment, I was not able to mount the SD card. However, I have included the code that worked for me when I have developed it in a separate activity.

8)Set of features to be implemented or next steps 
It is important to find the way to package the images with the app in certain folder. This to allow the app to load them and then show them in the gridviews and the tabs.
In addition, it might be important to fix accessing SD card from the Tab Fragment to allow having password saved to control the application.
